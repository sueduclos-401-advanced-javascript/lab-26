Code 401 Class 26 Custom Hooks

## Project Name - ToDo app

Create a ToDo application, utilizing functional components and the Hooks API.

Your ToDo application should have the following features:

Users should have access to a form where a new ToDo task can be added. This form should have the following fields:

* Task Description / Text
* Assigned To
* Status (complete or incomplete)
* Difficulty (a number between 1 and 5)

When users submit their new task form, they should see their task appear in a list of current tasks. This list should allow you to select any task to toggle it from complete to incomplete or vice versa.

* For this lab, your application does not have to persist tasks after application reload / refresh.
The title on the browser tab should update to show the number of incomplete tasks. For example, the title could read “4 Incomplete ToDo Items” or something similar.
